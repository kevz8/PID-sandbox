# PID Sandbox

**2D Physics-Based Bot Simulator with PID control, Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,and Pathfinding**  

---

## Overview

PID Sandbox is a C++ simulation environment built with Raylib to model and test real-time bot motion, physics, and obstacle traversal with self-correction algorithms with PID. The simulator combines **grid-based pathfinding**, **modular architecture**, and **physics modelling** including acceleration, velocity, and environmental forces (like wind).  

Features:
- **Interactive GUI** showing the grid, obstacles, path, and bot movement 
- **Motion planning & trajectory generation** using A* pathfinding  
- **Physics simulation** with acceleration, velocity, and bouncing mechanics  
- **Dynamic obstacle handling** to simulate real-world environmental changes  
- **Modular design** separating grid management, bot physics, and visualization for scalability
- **Real-time 2D simulation** of a bot navigating a grid environment  
- **Dynamic obstacle placement** and removal with mouse input  
- **Wind effects** that influence bot motion for environmental testing   
- **PID control** for bot navigation  
- **Adaptive path recalculation** when obstacles block the botâ€™s path
